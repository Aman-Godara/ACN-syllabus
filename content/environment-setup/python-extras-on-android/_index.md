You can use ACode to write python code too. Just be sure to save your files with the `.py` extension.

To run your python files, you need to use Termux.

First install python like so:

```
pkg install python
```

To check what version o python is installed you can use the command:

```
python --version
```

The version number should be >= 3.9

Then you can open a python interpreter at any point with the command `python`.

You can also run your python scripts like so:

```
cd /path/to/wherever/you/stored/your/goodies
python my_script.py
```

Try it out and remember to ask for help if you get stuck.
