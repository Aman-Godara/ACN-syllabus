title: The journey of an Umuzi recruit
---

This might be your first real introduction to what we at Umuzi are all about. 

## Umuzi's mission

Umuziâ€™s mission is to help high potential young people access high value digital careers.

In order to do this we have worked with corporate partners to invest in young people and support their career journeys.

We measure ourselves by looking at the people we have helped. The more careers we launch and lives we change the better. 

## Your Journey

There are a few phases of the Umuzi recruit user journey. What's a recruit? Keep reading and you'll find out.

Here are all the phases to the journey:

### 1. Applying online

You have already done this, otherwise you wouldn't be here.

In the background, we mark your tests and figure out who might be able to make it with us. If we think you have potential then we invite you to a selection bootcamp.

### 2. Bootcamp

You are here.

We make decisions about who is in and who is out in our bootcamp. 

We've found that our recruits do best when they are able to:

- **hold themselves accountable** if we bring people onto the program who aren't willing to do their homework without being pulled into disciplinary hearings then that's a giant waste of time. We are looking for adults who we can trust to get things done. 
- **pursue understanding** those people who copy random bits of code off the Internet don't go far in life

The bootcamp is run using our own custom built learning platform. There will be a bit of a learning curve and you'll probably get confused, but there will be staff on hand to help you out if you get stuck. Please make sure you ask questions when you get stuck!

During the bootcamp you'll have a bit of work to do, and you'll have a few interviews and tests with different people.

PLEASE NOTE: the bootcamp should be treated like a full time job! Spend at least a full workday on your course every single day!

It is your responsibility to:

- make sure you have the time and space to do this
- make sure you are available for all your scheduled interviews, tests and workshops

Here at Umuzi, we require professional behavior. 

- A professional shows up and does the work
- A professional pursues understanding
- A professional tries to solve their own problems
- A professional asks for help when they need it
- A professional helps the people around them. That's right, if someone asks for help and you help them then that's a win

### 3. Contract signing

Once bootcamp is finished, Umuzi staff members (and our trusty robots) will make a final selection of who gets into our program. Those people will be offered contracts with us and will be referred to as "recruits". Here are a few details:

- you will technically be an Umuzi employee, your job will be to grow your skills. You will be expected to follow staff members instructions and to behave professionally
- You will get paid during your learnership. Umuzi is committed to pay you every month while you are with us. Yes, that's right! We'll pay YOU to study with us. Usually people pay good money to have access to this kind of high quality education.

Once you've signed your contract, you'll be an Umuzi recruit.

There are different kinds of recruits on different programs with different requirements

### 4. Level-up your foundational skills

The next phase is learning. You'll be familiar with how we do things from going through our bootcamp. We'll give you a whole lot of learning to do, and lots of projects and assessments to hone your skillz.

You'll be expected to work like a real professional. You will be immersed in modern agile development practices from day 1. You'll learn hard skills, interact with your peers and overcome challenges you never thought you could.

At the end of this you'll have an NQF level 5 National Certificate in IT, and some solid, proven skills, and a network of high potential indviduals who know what you are about.


### 5. Use your skills

Depending on how you grow there are a few different doors that can open to you.

You can be given a technical leadership role so that you can build your skills while building the people around you.

You could get to contribute to one of our organization's projects. Tilde was built by Umuzi and it's still under construction. There's also a lot of work to be done on our syllabus because it can always be improved. We have a lot of really interesting problems to solve, and we are always trying to do things better. You can leave your mark.

### 6. External work experience

After the first 9 months of your contract with us, we start watching you extra closely and preparing you for job interviews. This 

If we believe that you are work-ready then we hustle to get you an internship at an external company.

**Note:** If you are not work ready at this point, we will not be sending you out. We only send out our stars. So be awesome! Umuzi is a reputable training organization and we will only vouch for you if we believe in you.

Also if you are contracted to one of our partners already then we might not be able to send you out somewhere else for work experience. So this isn't a 100% certain thing.
### 7. Job time! But it's not the end...

Once your time with us is up you should be ready for work. As long as you put in the effort during our course and behave professionally then you'll be good to go.

We have a team of recruitment ninjas and a large network of employer partners. We're pretty good at placing people in jobs.

We'll work hard to get you placed in a job, and if your job doesn't last for whatever reason then you can get in touch with us and we'll work hard to hook you up again. 

Of course you need to be a "work ready" professional for us to do this. 
### 8. Alumni Program

Once you have gone through our program you are one of the family and we'll continue supporting your career. You will have ongoing access to our services and syllabus.

As mentioned, if you are ever in need of a job you can let us know and we'll work hard to get you sorted out. Our recruitment ninjas are always happy to assist, and our network of employer organizations keeps growing.

On top of that, we will support your continued learning by keeping our platform and syllabus open to you. You'll be able to register for other courses that we run, some of those courses will be advanced specializations. When you complete these courses we'll be able to give you our stamp of approval.

Our course offerings grow all the time. Maybe you are a web dev who wants to learn about cross platform mobile development, we'll hook you up! Maybe you are a data-scientist and you want to learn about productionising your pipelines, we got you!

### 9. Pay it forward

Umuzi is dedicated to opening doors for people like you! After you get your first job after Umuzi, we'll need you to help us open doors for others. Basically, all the stuff we do is quite expensive and we need to stay afloat. So our graduates help out by giving back a small portion of their salary for a little while.

In total the required pay-it-forward amount is R34500, although some people choose to give more. It might seem like a lot to you now but it wont seem like much once you get cracking on your career. Also we wouldn't ask for it to be paid all at once or anything crazy like that. 

Umuzi will work out a repayment plan that works for your pocket. Basically how it works is that you wont need to pay unless you are earning enough to do so. And payments will be calculated as a portion of your paycheck. We want to make sure that we don't put you into a tough position so we stretch this out a bit so it's easy.

All funds paid forward to Umuzi from recruits goes into an to supporting the next generation of talent. 

### And they all lived happily ever after
