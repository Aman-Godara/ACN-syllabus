As a coder, it's important to stay hip with the times. The tech landscape is huge. There is new stuff happening all the time. You don't need to be an expert in everything but it's important to know what tools are out there so you can pick up the skills you need as you need them.

And on the other hand coding has a solid core of good practices and hard-won lessons you should become expert at. There are certain meta-skills that will make the acquisition and use of other skills way easier. There are some skills that will amplify your abilities forever.

What follows below are a few favorites. This list will change from time to time. So watch this space :)

## This page is for everyone

We teach a bunch of different things, so if there is a resource that is only relevant to one of our courses that will be included separately. This page is for everyone. Eg Java devs don't care about RealPython.

## Websites

- https://dev.to/ This is a community of devs. You'll find lots of tutorials and news here
- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/ - "Smashing Magazine delivers reliable, useful, but most importantly practical articles to web designers and developers." This is mostly for web devs, but there is a lot in here
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ FCC is a really good resource for learning to code. And look! They have a blog
- https://hackernoon.com/

## Books

These cost money but are seriously worth reading! Try get hold of a copy if you can.

Let's think about carpentry for a moment. There are some people who can barely nail two pieces of wood together, and then there are masters of their craft. These books are about software as a craft, how to know good from bad, how to optimize your own efforts, where to pay attention.

These aren't about specific technologies, they're about your craft.

- [The Clean Coder](https://amzn.to/38l3TZD)
- [The Mythical Man Month](https://amzn.to/3aw0I48)

## On "CV Padding" versus growing

A lot of techies like to do random little tutorials on the Internet then claim they know a skill. Eg, do the Django tutorial, then put Django on their CV. Collecting random skills to make your CV look better is a waste of time.

Rather build a meaningful CV by building novel things. Eg let's say you want to learn how to use Apollo.

1. Do the tutorial
2. build something real. Make a household shopping list app or something else, and mention that in your CV as a personal project
