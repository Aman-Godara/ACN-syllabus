This is just a placeholder to show how we can deal with nqf assessments for now.

- make sure the title is an actual title, not just a number
- link to gnomio. If you can link straight to the assessment that they need to do then that's even better.
- prerequisites should be included too. Make sure you link to the relevent qf content that covers the work being assessed
